#A Control Flow Primer

Chances are, you’ve been exposed to the concept of a flowchart, which is a visual way of representing control flow.  

The game is simple: there’s a mat with six squares with symbols for “Crown,” “Anchor,” “Heart,” “Club,” “Spade,” and “Diamond.” The sailor places any number of coins on any combination of the squares: these become the bets. Then he1 rolls three six-sided dice with faces that match the squares on the mat. For each die that matches a square that has a bet on it, the sailor wins that amount of money. Here are some examples of how the sailor might play, and what the payout is:

While it’s unlikely that you will ever need to simulate the gambling behaviors of 19th-century sailors, this type of simulation is quite common in many applications. In the case of Crown and Anchor, perhaps we have constructed a mathematical model to determine if we should open a Crown and Anchor booth to raise money for charity at our next company event. The simulation we construct in this chapter can be used to support the correctness of our model.  

Let’s begin with the basics: starting and stopping conditions. Every time Thomas gets shore leave, he takes 50 pence with him to spend on Crown and Anchor. Thomas has a limit: if he’s lucky enough to double his money, he quits, walking away with at least 100 pence in his pocket (about half his monthly wages). If he doesn’t double his money, he gambles until he’s broke.  

We’ll break the playing of the game into three parts: placing the bets, rolling the dice, and collecting the winnings (if any). Now that we have a very simple, high-level picture of Thomas’s behavior, we can draw a flowchart to describe it  
![flow-chart](./images/control-flow-flowChart.png)

In a flowchart, the diamond shapes represent “yes or no” decisions, and the rectangles represent actions. We use circles to describe where to start and end.  

we’ll restrict our flowchart actions to the following:
 * Variable assignment: `funds = 50, bets = {}, hand = []`
 * Random integer between m and n, inclusive: `rand(1, 6)` (this is a “helper function” we will be providing later)
 * Random face string (“heart,” “crown,” etc.): `randFace()` (another helper function)
 * Object property assignment: `bets["heart"] = 5, bets[randFace()] = 5`
 * Adding elements to an array: `hand.push(randFace())`
 * Basic arithmetic: `funds - totalBet, funds + winning`
 * Increment: `roll++` (this is a common shorthand that just means “add one to the variable roll”)

And we’ll limit our flowchart decisions to the following:
 * Numeric comparisons `(funds > 0, funds < 100)`
 * Equality comparisons `(totalBet === 7;` we’ll learn why we use three equals signs in Chapter 5)
 * Logical operators `(funds > 0 && funds < 100;` the double ampersand means “and,”)

Now that we know the limited language we can use, we’ll have to rewrite our flowchart as shown here:

![flow-chart-refined](./images/control-flow-flowChart-refined.png)

A while loop repeats code as long as its condition is met. In our flowchart, the condition is `funds > 1 && funds < 100`. Let’s see how that looks in code:

```javascript
let funds = 50;     // starting conditions
while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {
	// place bets
	// roll dice
	// collect winnings 
}
```

##Block Statements

 A block statement is just a series of statements enclosed in curly braces that is treated by JavaScript as a single unit. While it is possible to have a block statement by itself, it has little utility. For example:

```javascript
{   // start block statement
	console.log("statement 1");
	console.log("statement 2");
}   // end block statement
console.log("statement 3");
```

For example, if we wanted to take “two steps forward and one step back,” we could write:

```javascript
let funds = 50;     // starting conditions
while(funds > 1 && funds < 100) {
	funds = funds + 2;  // two steps forward
	funds = funds - 1;  // one step back
}
```

##Helper Functions

```javascript
// returns a random integer in the range [m, n] (inclusive)
function rand(m, n) {
	return m + Math.floor((n - m + 1)*Math.random());
}
// randomly returns a string representing one of the six // Crown and Anchor faces 
function randFace() {
	return ["crown", "anchor", "heart", "spade", "club", "diamond"]
		[rand(0, 5)];
}
```

##if...else Statement

One of the shaded boxes in our flowchart is “place bets,” which we’ll fill out now. So how does Thomas place bets? Thomas has a ritual, as it turns out. He reaches into his right pocket and randomly pulls out a handful of coins (as few as one, or as many as all of them). That will be his funds for this round. Thomas is superstitious, however, and believes the number 7 is lucky. So if he happens to pull out 7 pence, he reaches back into his pocket and bets all his money on the “Heart” square. Otherwise, he randomly places the bet on some number of squares  

![place-bets](./images/place-bets-flowChart.png)

The decision node in the middle (totalBet === 7) here represents an if...else statement. Note that, unlike the while statement, it doesn’t loop back on itself: the decision is made, and then you move on. We translate this flowchart into JavaScript:

```javascript
const bets = {
	crown   : 0,
	anchor  : 0,
	heart   : 0,
	spade   : 0,
	club    : 0,
	diamond : 0
};
let totalBet = rand(1, funds);
if(totalBet === 7) {
	totalBet = funds;
	bets.heart = totalBet;
} else {
	// distribute total bet
}
funds = funds - totalBet;
```

##do...while Loop

When Thomas doesn’t pull out 7 pence by chance, he randomly distributes the funds among the squares. He has a ritual for doing this: he holds the coins in his right hand, and with his left hand, selects a random number of them (as few as one, and as many as all of them), and places it on a random square (sometimes he places a bet on the same square more than once). We can now update our flowchart to show this random distribution of the total bet, shown here

![place-bets](./images/distribute-bets-flowChart.png)

Note how this differs from the while loop: the decision comes at the end, not the beginning. do...while loops are for when you know you always want to execute the body of the loop at least once (if the condition in a while loop starts off as falsy, it won’t even run once).  

```javascript
let remaining = totalBet;
do {
	let bet = rand(1, remaining);
	let face = randFace();
	bets[face] = bets[face] + bet;
	remaining = remaining - bet;
} while(remaining > 0);
```

##forLoop

The for loop is extremely flexible (it can even replace a while or do...while loop), but it’s best suited for those times when you need to do things a fixed number of times (especially when you need to know which step you’re on), which makes it ideal for rolling a fixed number of dice (three, in this case). Let’s start with our “roll dice” flowchart

![place-bets](./images/roll-dice-flowChart.png)

A for loop consists of three parts: the initializer (roll = 0), the condition (roll < 3), and the final expression (roll++).

```javascript
const hand = [];
for(let roll = 0; roll < 3; roll++) {
	hand.push(randFace());
}
```

##if Statement

 We have three random faces in the hand array, so we’ll use another for loop to see if any of them are winners. To do that, we’ll use an if statement (this time without an else clause).  
Notice the difference between an if...else statement and an if statement: only one of the if statement’s branches lead to an action, whereas both of the if...else statement’s do.

```javascript
let winnings = 0;
for(let die=0; die < hand.length; die++) {
	let face = hand[die];
	if(bets[face] > 0) winnings = winnings + bets[face];
}
funds = funds + winnings;
```

Note that, instead of counting to 3 in the for loop, we count to hand.length (which happens to be 3). The goal of this part of the program is to calculate the winnings for any hand. While the rules of the game call for a hand of three dice, the rules could change…or perhaps more dice are given as a bonus, or fewer dice are given as a penalty. The point is, it costs us very little to make this code more generic. If we change the rules to allow more or fewer dice in a hand, we don’t have to worry about changing this code: it will do the correct thing no matter how many dice there are in the hand

##Putting it all Together

```javascript
// returns a random integer in the range [m, n] (inclusive)
function rand(m, n) {
	return m + Math.floor((n - m + 1)*Math.random());
}

// randomly returns a string representing one of the six
// Crown and Anchor faces
function randFace() {
	return ['crown', 'anchor', 'heart', 'spade', 'club', 'diamond'][rand(0, 5)];
}

let funds = 50;     // starting conditions
let round = 0;

while (funds > 1 && funds < 100) {
	round++;
	console.log(`round ${round}:`);
	console.log(`\tstarting funds: ${funds}p`);

	// place bets
	let bets = {
		crown   : 0,
		anchor  : 0,
		heart   : 0,
		spade   : 0,
		club    : 0,
		diamond : 0,
	};
	let totalBet = rand(1, funds);

	if (totalBet === 7) {
		totalBet = funds;
		bets.heart = totalBet;
	} else {

		// distribute total bet
		let remaining = totalBet;

		do {
			const bet = rand(1, remaining);
			const face = randFace();

			bets[face] = bets[face] + bet;
			remaining = remaining - bet;
		} while (remaining > 0);
	}
	funds = funds - totalBet;
	console.log('\tbets: '
		+ Object.keys(bets)
			.map(face => `${face}: ${bets[face]} pence`)
			.join(', ')
		+ ` (total: ${totalBet} pence)`);

	// roll dice
	const hand = [];

	for (let roll = 0; roll < 3; roll++) {
		hand.push(randFace());
	}
	console.log(`\thand: ${hand.join(', ')}`);

	// collect winnings
	let winnings = 0;

	for (let die = 0; die < hand.length; die++) {
		let face = hand[die];

		if (bets[face] > 0) winnings = winnings + bets[face];
	}
	funds = funds + winnings;
	console.log(`\twinnings: ${winnings}`);
}
	console.log(`\tending funds: ${funds}`);
```

##Control Flow Statements in Javascript

Broadly speaking, control flow can be broken into two subcategories: conditional (or branching) control flow and loop control flow. Conditional control flow (if and if...else, and switch) represent a fork in the road: there are two or more paths to take, and we take one, but we don’t double back. Loop control flow (while, do...while, and for loops) repeat their bodies until a condition is met. 

##Control Flow Exceptions

There are four statements that can alter the normal processing of flow control. You can think of these as control flow “trump cards”:

 * break
	* Breaks out of loop early.
 * continue
	* Skip to the next step in the loop.
 * return
	* Exits the current function (regardless of control flow).
 * throw
	* Indicates an exception that must be caught by an exception handler (even if it’s outside of the current control flow statement).

##Chaining if...else Statements

```javascript
if (new Date().getDay() === 3) {   // new Date().getDay() returns the current
	totalBet = 1;                 // numeric day of the week, with 0 = Sunday
} else if(funds === 7) {
	totalBet = funds;
} else {
	console.log("No superstition here!");
}
```
By combining if...else statements this way, we’ve created a three-way choice, instead of simply a two-way choice.

###Metasyntax

The term metasyntax means a syntax that, in turn, describes or communicates yet another syntax.  
There are only two real elements to this metasyntax: something surrounded by square brackets is optional, and an ellipsis (three periods, technically) indicates “more goes here.” Words are used as placeholders, and their meaning is clear from context. For example, statement1 and statement2 represent two different statements, expression is something that results in a value, and condition refers to an expression that is treated as truthy or falsy.

__while statement__

```javascript
while(condition)
	statement
```
While condition is truthy, statement will be executed.  

__if...else statement__

```javascript
if(condition)
	statement1
	[else
		statement2]
```
If condition is truthy, statement1 will be executed; otherwise, statement2 will be executed (assuming the else part is present).

__do...while statement__

```javascript
do
	statement
while(condition);
```
statement is executed at least once, and is repeatedly executed as long as condition is truthy.

__for statement__

```javascript
for([initialization]; [condition]; [final-expression])
	statement
```
Before the loop runs, initialization is executed. As long as condition is true, statement is executed, then final-expression is executed before testing condition again.
